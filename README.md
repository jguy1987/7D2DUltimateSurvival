# 7D2DUltimateSurvival
The ultimate in survival mods for 7D2D. Making the game more difficult to survive.

The goal is to make the early and mid game more difficult and focus on survival and progression without the broken trader.

Major changes:
* Clay usage in the forge is increased per recipe. This is to account for mold making. Speed has also been decreased.
* Empty Jars are making a comeback, both in loot and craftable. Looting empty jars has the same rarity as finding Tea or Coffee in loot. Crafting Empty Jars requires Sand for the glass, Clay for the mold, Iron for the cap. Empty jars and murky water stacking has been reduced to 20. You may fill empty water jars at water sources to become Murky water.
* Repairing Weapons now require a weapon specific repair kit which is made from a regular repair kit (which is more expensive), and a part from the class of weapon (so, for example, all pistols require a "Pistol Repair Kit" which is crafted from a Repair Kit and Handgun part)
* Boiling water now takes a bit more time and fuel. Still requires a cooking pot. 
* Dew Collectors have been removed from the game.
* Crafting guns is more detailed as in the old days of 7D2D. Each weapon which uses bullets requires you to build the stock part, receiver part, barrel part, and, if applicable, the magazine part. Each one requiring a varying amount of weapon parts. Pipe weapons are an exception.
* Pipe Rifle has received a slight damage increase and reduced reloading time.
* The skill magazines for all non-workstation related items have received a bit of overhaul. Instead of starting out with the knowledge to craft everything, you start out with the knowledge to craft a wooden club, primitive bow, and stone axe. All weapons & tools must have their schematic found, even if you find magazines for them. This makes 2 scenarios possible: 1 in which you find a bunch of magazines to level up your pistol crafting but no pistol schematic, or finding the Pistol schematic without ever have read a pistol magazine and being able to craft a level 1 Pistol and NOT even a level 1 Pipe Pistol. Vehicles, Traps, Electricity, and Workstations are unchanged.
* Traders have received a huge overhaul. All rewards related to workstations, vehicles have been removed. Traders almost exclusively only give out ammo, weapon parts, and supplies like Repair Kits and random materials as rewards.
* The ability to craft solar panels and cells have been added. Cells can only be crafted to level 2. Higher levels must be bought from the trader.
